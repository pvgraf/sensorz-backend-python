# sensorz-backend-python Flask App with uWSGI Server in Docker

This repository contains a Flask web application that is wrapped with a uWSGI server and Dockerized for easy deployment. The application uses an external volume to store its database.

## Features
- Flask web application
- uWSGI server for serving the application
- Docker container for isolation and easy deployment
- Database stored in an external volume for data persistence

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t <image_name> .
```
* Replace <image_name> with a meaningful name for your Docker image.

5. Run the Docker container by command:
```
docker run -p 5050:5050 -v /path/to/external_volume:/app/data <image_name>
```
* Replace `/path/to/external_volume` with the actual path to the external volume on your machine.
* *  Replace <image_name> with your Docker image, previously created

6. Access the application in your web browser using the address `http://0.0.0.0:5050`
   Currently, only the following routes are implemented:
    - '/grades-by-student/<student_id>' (where `student_id` is an autogenerated ascending integer)
    - '/grades-by-subject/<subject>' (where `subject` one of the following `math`, `history` or `science`)
    - '/add-grades'
